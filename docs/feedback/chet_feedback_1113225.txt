Other Comments:
Colored tags for VIP, 1st-Timer, Attendee, Speaker, etc… – Like These
Could those alternatively be on the bottom of the badge as a row?
There could/would be other designations, like:
Donor, Board Member, Staff, Volunteer, etc…
QR Code:
As a way to facilitate to quick/easy contact swapping, I like it
Like it could perhaps point to an individual’s profile:
Maybe that’s for that specific event
Or when people fill out the form they can choose where they’d like for that QR code link to direct them to, like:
Their LinkedIn profile
Or their About us company website page,
Or maybe even it just likes to open up their contact card
That they can then quickly save to their phone
Template location
I’d be curious how this looks in one of the lower corners
NFC Tag alternative
Host could program a member’s contact card onto a sticker with NFC tag capability, and include that in a lower corner to make it easy to tap and swap.
Top Event Name & date
I’ve envisioned these to be reused and kept by the hosts for their guests to leave behind for the next event,
But having a single, specific event name/date could/would have some value too, so good to keep as a template option.
